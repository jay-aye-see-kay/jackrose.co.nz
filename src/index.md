# Jack's website

## About

Like most software developers I want to write more than I do, and I've spent 10x more time [re]writing software for my own website/blog than writing prose for it. So this time around I'm making a deal with myself; each time I write and publish something, I can add a new feature to the site. Writing about the blog itself is allowed but doesn't count in this deal.

If you're wondering why the styling is so basic and there's no navbar, it's because I haven't written enough to jusitfy those features yet. Coming soon!

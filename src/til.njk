<h1>TILS</h1>
<p>
  TIL (or today I learned) are short snippets of things I learned and found
  interesting. I write them down so I can use them as a future reference,
  and hopefully they'll be helpful to others occasionally too.
</p>
<p>
  They're shorter and lower quality than blog posts, that's the main reason
  they're separated from posts - to give myself permission to leave these
  less polished that I otherwise would.

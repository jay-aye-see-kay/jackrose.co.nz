# The Deal

To encourage myself to write more prose and not just tinker with the code of this website I've made a deal with myself that for each new page written and published I will allow myself to add a feature. In this case a feature is adding and configuring a plugin, or implementing a something mildly involved like a navbar or a tagging system.

In approximate order, the features want to add are:

- [ ] navbar (build from scratch)
- [x] [code highlighting](https://lume.land/plugins/code_highlight/)
- [ ] [a rss feed](https://lume.land/plugins/feed/)
- [ ] a basic theme, probably copied from somewhere
- [ ] make external links look different to internal ones
- [ ] favicon and page titles
- [ ] [add reading info to posts](https://lume.land/plugins/reading_info/) (post date/updated, word count, reading time)
- [ ] link posts to their source on github to view their history
- [ ] a post tagging system and a tags page
- [ ] [site search](https://lume.land/plugins/pagefind/)
- [ ] deploy to AWS or Cloudflare instead of Vercel
- [ ] comments based on github issues

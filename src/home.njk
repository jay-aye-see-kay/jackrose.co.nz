<h2>About</h2>
<p>Like most software developers I want to write more than I do, and I've spent 10x more time [re]writing software for
  my own website/blog than writing prose for it. So this time around I'm making a deal with myself; each time I write
  and publish something, I can add a new feature to the site. Writing about the blog itself is allowed but doesn't count
  in this deal.</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the styling is so basic and there's no navbar, it's because I haven't written enough to
  jusitfy those features yet. Coming soon!</p>

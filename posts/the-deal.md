# The Deal

To encourage myself to write more prose and not just tinker with the code of this website I've made a deal with myself that for each new page written and published I will allow myself to add a feature. In this case a feature is adding and configuring a plugin, or implementing a something mildly involved like a navbar or a tagging system.

In approximate order, the features want to add are:

- navbar (build from scratch)
- [code highlighting](https://lume.land/plugins/code_highlight/)
- [a rss feed](https://lume.land/plugins/feed/)
- a basic theme, probably copied from somewhere
- make external links look different to internal ones
- favicon and page titles
- [add reading info to posts](https://lume.land/plugins/reading_info/) (post date/updated, word count, reading time)
- a post tagging system and a tags page
- [site search](https://lume.land/plugins/pagefind/)
- deploy to AWS (s3 and cloudfront) instead of Vercel

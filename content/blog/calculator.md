This was a vanilla JS calculator with a design based on a classic Casio. It was made as a FreeCodeCamp project.

I built this without using a front end library because I wanted practice my JavaScript skills. Using Vue or React would’ve made this project simpler but that wasn’t the goal.

Hover your mouse over the ‘solar panel’ for my attempt at an easter egg.

Previously my website was a simple portfolio site that I made as a junior developer looking for work. Its purpose was to prove that I could build and deploy basic websites and put together JS widgets. Now I have more experience I don't believe a portfolio site benefits me at all, and I want to set up my site for blogging, so all previous portfolio pages now redirect here.

While I doubt anyone ever bookmarked any of my portfolio pages, link rot sucks and I didn't want to add any more to the internet. So here is a summary of my old portfolio pages.

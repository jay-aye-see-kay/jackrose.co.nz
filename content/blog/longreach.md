Longreach recruitment is a new small recruitment agency in Perth, Australia. They wanted a simple but effective site.

The interesting part of this site was the angled background images. As jpeg does not support transperancy, and pngs donâ€™t store photos efficiently, I used a combination of jpegs with colored svg overlays. While simple to implement on the modern browsers, this required extensive trial and error to work well on IE11.

The end result was a professional modern site that loads quick crisp images.

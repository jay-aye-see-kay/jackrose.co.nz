The FreeCodeCamp Front End Certification is a 400 hour course covering the basic HTML, Bootstrap 3, jQuery, and ES6 fundimentals. I completed the course in May 2018.

I started working through FreeCodeCamp at the start of 2017 when I decided I wanted to switch careers to web development. I started my first web dev job in March 2017 and found myself learning Wordpress and PHP so FreeCodeCamp was put on old. With the release of FreeCodeCamps new and much more complete curriculum Iâ€™ve decided to return to it. You can see my current progress at: [freecodecamp.org/jack](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jack).

Note: My progress from the old curriculum was transferred to the new one and I basically got the Javascript Certificate for free, so the two certificated below represent around 400 hours of work not 700.

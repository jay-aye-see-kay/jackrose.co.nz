title: Your programming language is not a tool

While discussing programming languages, developers will often use the metaphor that their programming language is their tool, like a builder or a chef we prioritise a sharp, safe, or reliable tools. We will help justify our choice of language based on this metaphor, that our programming language is just like a chef's knife or a builder's chisel.

Except this metaphor doesn't stand up to much scrutiny, a builder takes their tools with them when they leave a job. A chef doesn't leave their knife in your dinner. You can see where I'm going with this, programming languages are much more like a builder's lumber than their chisel.

Tools are what we use to build something, materials stay behind for other developers and our customers to live with.

So what are our tools? Our laptops, operating systems, text editors, keyboards, plugin laden web browsers. Definitely. Make these are sharp as you like, you alone get the benefits and the cuts. But before starting a new project in your favourite ultra-flexible dynamically typed language, spare a thought for your future colleagues (and future self) and try not to build a kitchen out of knives.

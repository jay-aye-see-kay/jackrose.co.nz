PSZ accountants are a Perth based firm that needed a modern new site.

From a developer’s point of view (mine) the site wasn’t particularly remarkable, we used the Kleo Wordpress theme to get us started quickly.

The "our clients" page is interesting though, the layout was too complex for bootstrap columns so we had to make use of position absolute layouts, and some media queries so it looked as much like the mock up on all devices.

Design by Josh from [Superminimal](https://superminimal.com.au/), development by me.

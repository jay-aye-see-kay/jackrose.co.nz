Blazing Swan is Perthâ€™s Regional Burning Man event. In 2018 I was lucky enough to be the designer and project lead of the Temple.

For many people the temple symbolises letting go. During the week people write messages in the temple to lost loved ones, or objects special to them inside the temple. When the temple burns on Sunday night the crowd is quiet and the atmosphere is surprisingly intense.

The temple took 2 months of part-time building in a workshop in Perth, and 2 weeks full-time building on site. There was also an approximately 6 month preparatory period to organise budgets, materials, and structural engineering. It took all 10 crew members with our variety of skillsets to make this a reality.

The temple stood 13.4m vertically making it, for one week, the largest sundial in the southern hemisphere.
